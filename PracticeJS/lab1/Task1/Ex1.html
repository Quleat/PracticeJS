                &emsp; Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of 
                Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kyoto. At such a 
                great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads 
                at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kyoto wanted to visit Osaka, and 
                the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kyoto, where the great Mikado had his palace.

            <p> &emsp; So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kyoto to Osaka, one from one 
                end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about 
                traveling, and halfway between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time 
                and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another 
                frog before him!
